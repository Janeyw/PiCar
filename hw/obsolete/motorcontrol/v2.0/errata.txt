- RPi-Arduino SPI connection does not work due to lack of Slave Select
  (SS) connection. One solution is to add jumper wire between
  ATMega32u4 Pin 8 (PB0) and RPi Connection Pin 15 (GPIO22).

- Capacitor C22 makes ADG3304 become unstable (oscillations at
  ~8MHz). DO NOT SOLDER.

- Resistors R31 and R44 are not necessary, IMU comes with its own
  pull-up resistors.

- Although Vout is rated for 6A, U11 is only rated for 4A. Hence, U11
  will fail (i.e., crack open) if the +5V carries more than ~4A.

- S2P2 does not work as expected. This is an open bug, it is unclear
  if the problem is the board design or ATMega32u4's fuse
  configuration.
