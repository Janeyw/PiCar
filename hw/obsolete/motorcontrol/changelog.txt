v2.1
====
- Changed all the devices that were hard to solder (pads smaller than
  1mil) for useful equivalents.

- RPi-ATMega32u4 communication using either SPI or UART. New Slave
  Select connection using RPi's CE0. UART communication is
  recommended.

- Redesign RPi-ATMega32u4 voltage translation interface. Now using 2x
  SN74LV4T125. If RPi is not connected then RPi->ATMega32u4 lines
  become HiZ. S2P2 now controls HiZ state of RPi->ATMega32u4 SPI
  lines.

- SPI MOSI, SCLK, and CE0 lines are shared with Hall sensors. Hence,
  they cannot be used simultaneously. S2P2 *must* be open if Hall
  sensors are present. Also, Hall sensors must be read using Port B's
  general interrupt.

- Redesign ATRESET bus. Now S1 and RPIRESET can reset ATMega32u4.

- All connectors now follow RC toys' unspoken standard pinout: Pin 1
  is +5V, Pin 2 is GND, rest is for communication.

- New RCVR connector. Communication pin connected to ATMega32u4's
  ICP3. Use this connector read data from wireless receiver.

- New XIO connector. Communication pins connected to ATMega32u4's ICP1
  and OC1C (shared with motor controller). Use this connector to
  control an ESC module or read a second wireless receiver line.

- Encoder communication pins connected to INT6 and PB4.

- Servo communication pin connected to OC3A.

- U11 is now rated for 6A.

- S2P1 now controls state of ATMega32u4's HWB (PE2) pin.

- Motor controllers' IS now connected to ADC0, ADC1, and ADC4. Also,
  INH now connected to PF5, PF6, and PF7.

- Blue LED controlled via RPi GPIO23 and ATMega32u4 PD5. Green LED
  controlled via RPi GPIO18/PCMCLK.



v2.0
====
- Changed from 2 to 1 motor controllers.

- Add ATMega32u4 to read all the sensors and control motor.

- RPi-ATMega32u4 communication via SPI (see errata).

- Pi Hat compatible design.

- RPi back-power protection.

- Motor over-voltage protection.
