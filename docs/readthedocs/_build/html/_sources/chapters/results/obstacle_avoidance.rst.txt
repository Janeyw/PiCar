LIDAR Obstacle Avoidance
==========================

Proposal
---------

  Object tracking and obstacle avoidance are two key features for a robot with
  mechanical movability and visual detection functionality. They are associated
  with many hot application fields such as path followers and self-driving cars.
  With the big picture in mind, we chose to implement those basic functions on
  the PiCar, a Raspberry Pi powered and wheeled robotic car, as a research
  project. By implementing the obstacle avoidance and the object tracking
  features onto the car, we aim to create powerful and practical algorithms
  that enable the car to follow a certain object wisely without crashing into
  any obstacles.
