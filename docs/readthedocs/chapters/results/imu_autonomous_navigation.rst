IMU Autonomous Navigation
==========================

Proposal
--------

  There are three main objectives of our research:

  1. Building a working PiCar to carry out experiments
  2. Investigating IMU data
  3. Design algorithms for self-driving navigation

  First, working PiCar has to be built so that an autonomous driving system can be
  implemented. After the system has been implemented, IMU data then can be collected
  and explored through experiments. Finally, algorithms of locating the current location
  of the car based on IMU data can be developed.
