PiCar Mobile Movement Control
=============================

Proposal
---------

  This report is aimed at introducing new researchers to the findings and
  progress made on the PiCar Project as of July, 2018 regarding the movement
  control of the PiCar.  This report will cover the currently implemented
  features of the PiCar, including semi-automated movement,  a killswitch,
  real-time user control using WASD on a keyboard, a replay function, and data
  collection.  Additionally, the last section of the report covers known issues
  with the PiCar which includes inaccurate servo controls and noisy Inertial
  Measurement Unit (IMU) data.

.. note::

   While uploading the Arduino program, if there is an issue with the
   ``Simpletimer`` library, download the ``Simpletimer.h`` file from the
   `Official Arduino Codebase <http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/SimpleTimer>`_,
   and place it in the same folder as the ``WASD.ino`` file.
