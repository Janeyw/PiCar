Power Management
==========================

Proposal
---------

  There are many industrial robotics platforms, from large to small scale, from autonomous to
  manual manipulation. However, only a few studies the power monitoring and management.
  However, this filed will become increasingly important when robots are given more functionalities
  for various tasks desired. In this regard, the battery life could become an important criterion to
  judge whether a robot is suitable for the task.

  By studying each electric componentâ€™s power consumption, we can build a mathematical
  performance model and guide the user to decide which mode is supposed to operate to obtain a
  better performance. We believe, this model could also be used in the performance prediction
  field, which potentially saves more energy based on the same platform. Therefore, the success
  experiment could be extremely valuable for the industry.
